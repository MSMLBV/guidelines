# Welcome to MSML Code Guidelines

MSML Code Guidelines provide developers with a unified set of standards and best practices for building robust **Laravel applications** and **React Native mobile apps**. These guidelines ensure consistency, maintainability, and scalability across all MSML projects.

## Overview

At MSML, we develop cutting-edge Laravel applications and React Native mobile apps. These guidelines help our developers:
- Maintain consistency across all projects.
- Collaborate effectively with team members.
- Write code that is scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand.

### Why Code Guidelines Matter

Standardized coding practices reduce technical debt and streamline development, making it easier for teams to work on shared projects and onboard new developers.

### Focus Areas

- **Cross-Platform Best Practices**: Standards for working with both Laravel and React Native.
- **Naming Conventions**: Ensuring consistent names for controllers, models, requests, and React Native components.
- **Folder Structure**: Organizing files and directories for clarity and scalability.
- **Coding Principles**: Adopting clean coding practices and industry standards.

## Goals

### Consistency
Ensure that all code adheres to the same structure, style, and conventions, whether it’s for backend services in Laravel or UI components in React Native.

### Scalability
Write code that scales with the project, allowing teams to add features or functionality with minimal rework.

### Maintainability
Focus on making code easy to read, test, and debug by following best practices and avoiding complexity.
